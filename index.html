            <p class="w3-opacity">Software Developer & Cybersecurity Leader</p>
        </div>


        <p>I have an extensive professional and educational background in cybersecurity and software development
            and have been able to use that knowledge to help billion-dollar companies secure their technology
            environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a bachelor’s degree in Management Information Systems and an MBA concentrating in
            Cybersecurity Intelligence Leadership. I am also currently pursuing a master's degree
            in Computer and Information Technology at the University of Pennsylvania.
        </p>
        Continuous learning and improvement are at the core of my professional
        ethos. Since entering the workforce I have pursued multiple graduate
        degrees in cybersecurity and computer science. I have also studied
        for, and passed, several cybersecurity certification exams,
        including the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
        exam and the Security+ exam.
